<TITLE>Chipmunk Basic Readme</TITLE>
Chipmunk Basic is an old-fashioned Basic Interpreter

Chipmunk Basic 3.6.7 is free for educational and non-commercial
distribution and use (but only for those who don't believe that using
the BASIC programming language causes brain damage. :-)

Chipmunk Basic comes with limited documentation and a contributed nroff
man page; but the language is mostly compatible with the many books on
programming in BASIC that were circa 1978 thru 1990.  Line numbers are
required for program entry via the console, but line numbers are not
required on Basic programs loaded from text files.
